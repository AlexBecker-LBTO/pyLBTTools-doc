 #  Takes a single image with the specified camera (LBTtools.camera). Actions #
 #  differ depending on the camera you are registered as:                     #
 #                                                                            #
 #  LUCI:                                                                     #
 #  To take an exposure with LUCI, the camera UI must be up and the setup     #
 #  implemented as needed to take a reasonable exposiure.  This task just     #
 #  starts a pre-made LUCI script through an ssh remote execute call.  The    #
 #  pre-exchanged ssh keys must already be set up for this to work!           #
 #                                                                            #
 #  LBC:                                                                      #
 #  It is not currently known if it is possible to load an OB from a command  #
 #  line, but that would be necessary before this task could launch said OB   #
 #  through an ssh remote execute call.                                       #
 #                                                                            #
 #  MODS:                                                                     #
 #  A command line way to take an image with MODS in the instrument's current #
 #  configuration has been requested, it should be simple to implement once   #
 #  the equivalent command is working with LUCI.                              #
 #                                                                            #
 #  LBTI:                                                                     #
 #  It is not planned to remotely execute a "takepic" on LBTI, but it is      #
 #  conceivable that the Observe package could be used for testing LBTI and   #
 #  LBTI is a valid instrument to register as, so error-checking is included  #
 #  here for completeness.                                                    #
 #                                                                            #

 #  The current parameters of the camera are read out and printed to screen   #
 #  prior to setting the new exposure time and frame rate, and taking the     #
 #  image.  This works as before.                                             #
