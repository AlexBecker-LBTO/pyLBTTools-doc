 #  Moves the specified OPE in X,Y,Z,RX,RY, and RZ.  This "move" command      #
 #  includes the functionality of MoveXY, MoveXYZ, TipTilt, StepFocus, and    #
 #  MoveFocus (all are subsets of move).                                      #
 #                                                                            #
 #  This task is in active development, expect changes and bugs!              #
 #                                                                            #
 #  X,Y, and Z are specified in millimeters.                                  #
 #  RX, RY, RZ are currently specified in degrees, may change to arcsec.      #
 #                                                                            #
 #  Dflag - This move parameter is not visible to the user.  It is a flag     #
 #  indicating which of the requested directions is to be applied.  Normally  #
 #  this would be set to 63 (apply all six values even if they are zero.  But #
 #  there is a special meaning to 0 0 0 0 0 0 ABS, that moves the specified   #
 #  OPE to its 'magic' position.  So to make this more clear at 3:00am, if    #
 #  ABS+ the Dflag is built from the non-zero XYZRXRYRZ values.  The Dflag is #
 #  set to 63 for an absolute move only if the set2magic flag is also set.    #
 #  This should cover all normal options/uses of the move command.            #
 #                                                                            #
 #  It would probably be good practice to unlearn this command before use!    #
