 #  Creates the appropriate subdirectory structure in the current directory.  #
 #  All LBTtools reduction tasks assume this subdirectory structure, and will #
 #  not run correctly without it.  The prepdir task needs some information    #
 #  from the LBTtools pset, so those must be set appropriately before running #
 #  prepdir (or any other task in the LBTtools package).                      #
 #                                                                            #
 #  The "RAWdata" directory is no longer created.  The location of the raw    #
 #  images is given by the package "archive" parameter.  This could point to  #
 #  a local directory called "RAWdata", but that must be created by hand      #
 #  prior to running the other tasks in this package.  Images will be matched #
 #  using the name <camera>.<utdate>.*.fits or .fit for MAT data).  RAW data  #
 #  are never modified in the LBTtools/LBTtools packages.                     #
 #                                                                            #
 #  This task will create the following subdirectories:                       #
 #     * TMPdata  Any intermediate or temporary data that is not untimately   #
 #                to be saved are written here.  It is safe to delete this    #
 #                directory when the reductions are finished as the final     #
 #                data products are located in other subdirectories.  Set up  #
 #                so you can link to a ramdisk if you have one.               #
 #     * RAWdata  Local copy of RAW (or linearized) data.                     #
 #     * FFdata   Flat-fielded images (intermediate or final).                #
 #     * LOGs     All logs kept by the LBTtools tasks.                        #
 #     * Misc     Misc images (flats, darks) and list files (lists, offsets)  #
 #                supporting the reductions.                                  #
 #                                                                            #
