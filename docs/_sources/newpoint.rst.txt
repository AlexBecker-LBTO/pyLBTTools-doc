 #  Reads source and guide star information from the new catalog format as    #
 #  defined by DLMiller, then sets up and sends the IRC/IIF command to preset #
 #  the Telescope.  Returns (i.e. error checking and such) should now be      #
 #  properly handled.  Newpoint has been extended to support ADAPTIVE mode    #
 #  presets as well as send explicit offsets and hotspots with the preset.    #
 #                                                                            #
 #  SourceName: A file with the name <SourceName>.catalog must exist          #
 #    somewhere in the defined catalog path (see LBTtools.CatDir).  The first #
 #    source (ID=0) in the catalog is always used as the on-axis science      #
 #    target, other sources in the catalog are used for off-axis guide stars  #
 #    and referred to by their catalog number.  The same convention applies   #
 #    to the AO reference star also in the same catalog.                      #
 #                                                                            #
 #  PA: Detector position angle.  The default is set to INDEF.  If you        #
 #    request a guide star, the task will calculate the PA to place it at     #
 #    AGw X=0 (Yaxis).  If you also specify a PA, it will override the        #
 #    calculated PA.                                                          #
 #                                                                            #

 ### User-specified source and guide star catalogs ############################
 #                                                                            #
 #  To properly use a user-specified source catalog, it *must* be set up with #
 #  the same overall structure as the LBT default catalogs (DMiller format).  #
 #  See those for examples, examples can be found in LBTtools$/catalogs/.     #
 #                                                                            #
